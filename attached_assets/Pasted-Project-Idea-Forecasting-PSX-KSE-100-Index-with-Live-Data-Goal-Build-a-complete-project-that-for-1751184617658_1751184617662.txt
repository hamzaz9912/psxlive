Project Idea (Forecasting PSX KSE-100 Index with Live Data)
Goal: Build a complete project that forecasts the KSE-100 index of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), along with individual brand-wise forecasts, using live data fetched every 5 minutes. It should display forecast graphs and allow custom date selection for analysis.
‚úÖ Requirements:
1. Live Data Integration:
   * Use a library or API to fetch real-time stock data from PSX (KSE-100 and its companies).
   * The data should refresh and be fetched every 5 minutes.
   * Show real-time movements on a line graph/chart.
2. Forecasting:
   * Forecast for:
      * Today (intraday prediction)
      * Next day
      * Any custom date selected by the user.
   * Use machine learning (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet, etc.) for predictions.
3. Graphing:
   * Show forecast vs. actual price in a line graph (e.g., Plotly or Matplotlib).
   * Auto-update the graph every 5 minutes with new live data.
4. Individual Company Forecasts:
   * Fetch and predict for all brands listed under KSE-100 (e.g., OGDC, HBL, MCB, ENGRO, etc.).
   * Allow the user to select a specific brand from a dropdown to view its forecasts.
5. User Interface (UI):
   * UI built in Streamlit or any lightweight web dashboard.
   * Provide options to:
      * Select date range.
      * Choose brand.
      * See forecast charts.
      * Export data (optional).
6. Deployment:
   * Deploy on Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Heroku (preferably free tier).
   * Auto-refreshing dashboard without manual reload.
üîç Is this possible?
Yes, this is 100% possible.
üí° Free Data Sources (for PSX):
Unfortunately, PSX does not provide free APIs publicly like US stock markets. However, you can try the following:
1. Investing.com Unofficial API (via web scraping):
* Use investpy or custom requests + BeautifulSoup scraping.
* Limitation: May block after multiple requests.
* Some alternatives like yfinance won‚Äôt have PSX data.
2. TradingView Widget + Webhooks:
* TradingView has KSE-100 data you can scrape or embed.
* Not officially an API, but with automation, can work.
3. PSX Official Website (Scraping):
* You can write a scraper for KSE-100 live page.
* Needs handling dynamic JS and rate limits.
