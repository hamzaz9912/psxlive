# PSX KSE-100 Forecasting Dashboard

## Overview

This is a real-time stock market forecasting dashboard specifically designed for the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) KSE-100 index. The application provides live data fetching, predictive analytics, and interactive visualizations for the KSE-100 index and its constituent companies. The system automatically refreshes data every 5 minutes and offers forecasting capabilities for intraday, next-day, and custom date predictions.

## System Architecture
